            <p>
              You can list any account, even if you don't own it. You could even
              list @elonmusk â€” as long as it's not already listed. If you add an
              account owned by someone else, interest will begin to accrue to
              their wallet immediately, and they can claim it anytime.
            </p>
          <h5>List & Buy in one transaction</h5>
          
          <p>
              We highly recommend that you List & Buy when listing a new token.
              This is because when you list a new token, it starts at the lowest
              possible price. If you don't List & Buy in the same transaction, you
              might lose the opportunity to buy at the moment of minimum risk and
              maximum potential reward.
